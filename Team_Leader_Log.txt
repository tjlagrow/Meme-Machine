Project Title: Meme-Machine
Implementation Approach: Building a chat client and an image cipher.

(Meet 2/8/2016 Matt, Jacob, TJ)
Qt
made git hub
looked up gimp api 
Made paper design for the gui 
Matthew started thinking about some of the encryption (mostly more random than we did in the last project)

Goals: Jacob - get basic window up (text input at least up)
Matthew - something that modifies picture, work on a manipulation of some kind of pixel
TJ - Server work on ix, problem solve
Ian - work on the filter for pgn, and jpeg

png, jpeg, gzip, 

watch for quality reduction


-------


(Meeting of 2/15/2016 ian, TJ, Jacob, Matthew)

jacob has a working outline of a gui 
Ian said he will get a picture manipulating 

TJ will have a simple server and client code working.  With keys that will be associated with each chat instance.  Potentially use PThreading. Using an rand 1- max rand

Matthew  find a way to encrypt the images and the text.

(Meet 2/25/2016 matt, ian, jacob, tj)
Made a drawing of our client server chat
Talked about how to link up the gui
single instant server client is working for tj
->needs to have a chat instance for 2 chats
->have keys for the encryption
The client needs to be more modular 

The picture manipulation can’t use magik++
->trying to use gd or cing.

The picture manipulation can’t use magik++

Try to get the drag and drop to display a picture on the gui (found an example)
